# WPF AutoComplete TextBox

>WPF AutoComplete TextBox is an original work from [Bhardwaj Deepak](http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/801004/WPF-AutoComplete-TextBox)

This control originally features:

* Load suggestions on-demand
* Supports MVVM
* Asynchronously load suggestions
* Watermark
* Icon
* DataTemplate for suggestions
* DataTemplateSelector for suggestions

### My changes/improvements

1. I've included two more properties for making things easier:
  * MaxLength
  * CharacterCasing
2. Also, I fixed up the focus control.
3. Removed VB.NET stuff from original solution.
4. Added a new demo showcasing the new capabilities
5. Added a custom style in the new demo, turning on validation messages  
6. Added property MaxPopupHeight. Setting this property, will limit the popup height to the size you wish.

### The Demo WpfControls.Demo

It's a simple WPF application using the [Material Design in XAML Toolkit](http://materialdesigninxaml.net/) and MVVM showing how to search for the American States while typing.  See it in action!
